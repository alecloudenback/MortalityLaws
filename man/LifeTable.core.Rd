LifeTable.core(x, Dx = NULL, Ex = NULL, mx = NULL, qx = NULL,
  lx = NULL, dx = NULL, sex, lx0 = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of ages}

\item{Dx}{Vector containing death counts. An element of the vector, Dx, 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+1}

\item{Ex}{Vector containing the exposure in the period. 
Ex is the mid-year population aged x to x+1}

\item{mx}{age-specific death rates}

\item{qx}{probability of dying between age x and x+n}

\item{lx}{probability to survive up until age x}

\item{dx}{life table death counts at age x}

\item{sex}{sex of the population considered here. This argument affects the 
first two values in the life table ax column. The values are computed based 
on Coale-Demeny method and are sligthly different for males than for females.}

\item{lx0}{Radix. Default: 100 000}
