\title{MortalityLaws: Parametric Mortality Models, Life Tables and HMD}
\description{
Fit the most popular human mortality "laws", and construct 
full and abridge life tables given various input indices. A mortality
law is a parametric function that describes the dying-out process of 
individuals in a population during a significant portion of their 
life spans. For a comprehensive review of the most important mortality 
laws see Tabeau (\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-47562-6_1}{2001}).
An elegant function for downloading data from 
\href{https://www.mortality.org}{Human Mortality Database} is provided as well.
