\title{Life table function}
\usage{
LifeTable(x, Dx = NULL, Ex = NULL, mx = NULL, qx = NULL,
  sex = "total", lx0 = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of ages}

\item{Dx}{Vector containing death counts. An element of the vector, Dx, 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+1}

\item{Ex}{Vector containing the exposure in the period. 
Ex is the mid-year population aged x to x+1}

\item{mx}{age-specific death rates}

\item{qx}{probability of dying between age x and x+n}

\item{sex}{sex of the population considered here. This argument affects the 
first two values in the life table ax column. The values are computed based 
on Coale-Demeny method and are sligthly different for males than for females.}

\item{lx0}{Radix. Default: 100 000}
}
\value{
The output is of class \code{lifetable} with the components:

\item{lt}{ computed life table with rounded values}

\item{lt.exact}{ computed life table}

\item{process_date}{ time stamp}
}
\description{
Function to create a life table with various choices of 2 input vectors: 
\code{(x, Dx, Ex)} or \code{(x, mx)} or \code{(x, qx)}.
}
\examples{
#' # Example 1 --- Full life table --------------
x <- as.numeric(rownames(ahmd$mx))
year <- 1900

mx <- ahmd$mx[, paste(year)]
Dx <- ahmd$Dx[, paste(year)]
Ex <- ahmd$Ex[, paste(year)]

LifeTable(x, mx = mx)
LifeTable(x, Dx = Dx, Ex = Ex)

# Example 2 --- Abridge life table ------------
x  = c(0, 1, seq(5, 110, by = 5))
mx = c(.053, .005, .001, .0012, .0018, .002, .003, .004, 
       .004, .005, .006, .0093, .0129, .019, .031, .049, 
       .084, .129, .180, .2354, .3085, .390, .478, .551)
lt = LifeTable(x, mx = mx, sex = "female")
lt
