\title{Life table function}
\usage{
LifeTable(x, Dx = NULL, Ex = NULL, mx = NULL, qx = NULL, lx0 = 1e+05,
  ax0 = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of ages}

\item{Dx}{Vector containing death counts. An element of the vector, Dx, 
represents the number of deaths during the year to persons aged x to x+1}

\item{Ex}{Vector containing the exposure in the period. 
Ex is the mid-year population aged x to x+1}

\item{mx}{Age-specific death rates}

\item{qx}{1-year probability of dying between age x and x+1}

\item{lx0}{Radix. Default: 10^5.}

\item{ax0}{average time spent between age 0 and age 1 of those how died 
in age 0. For x > 0  we assume an uniform distribution of deaths (UDD).}
}
\value{
Life Tables
}
\description{
Simple function to create complete life table with input variables: 
(\code{age, Dx, Ex}) or (\code{age, mx}) or (\code{age, qx}).
}
\details{
The function doesn't know how to deal 
with abridge life tables (errors might be expected). You may find a solution 
for this and much more please in the \href{https://github.com/jschoeley/pash}{pash} 
R package on GitHub.

\examples{
library(MortalityLaws)

ages <- as.numeric(rownames(ahmd$mx))
year <- 1900

mx <- ahmd$mx[, paste(year)]
Dx <- ahmd$Dx[, paste(year)]
Nx <- ahmd$Ex[, paste(year)]

LifeTable(x = ages, mx = mx)$lt
LifeTable(x = ages, Dx = Dx, Ex = Nx)$lt
}
